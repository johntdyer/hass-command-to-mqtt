This add-on connects to remote hosts via SSH, executes commands, and publishes the results as auto-discoverable sensors in Home Assistant through MQTT.

## About

The SSH Command to MQTT add-on allows you to:

- Connect to multiple remote hosts via SSH
- Execute custom commands on a scheduled basis
- Automatically create Home Assistant sensors via MQTT discovery
- Support both password and private key authentication
- Configure different execution intervals for each command

## Installation

1. Add this repository to your Home Assistant add-on store
2. Install the "SSH Command to MQTT" add-on
3. Configure the add-on with your SSH hosts and commands
4. Start the add-on

## Example Commands

### System Monitoring

```yaml
commands:
  - name: "cpu_usage"
    command: "top -bn1 | grep 'Cpu(s)' | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/%us,//'"
    interval: 60
    unit_of_measurement: "%"

  - name: "memory_usage"
    command: "free | grep Mem | awk '{printf \"%.2f\", ($3/$2) * 100.0}'"
    interval: 120
    unit_of_measurement: "%"

  - name: "disk_usage_root"
    command: "df -h / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//'"
    interval: 300
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
```

### Network Monitoring

```yaml
commands:
  - name: "ping_google"
    command: "ping -c 1 8.8.8.8 | grep 'time=' | awk -F'time=' '{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}'"

    unit_of_measurement: "ms"
```

## Troubleshooting

### SSH Connection Issues

1. Verify the hostname/IP and port are correct
2. Check SSH credentials (username/password or private key)
3. Ensure SSH service is running on the target host
4. Check firewall settings on both hosts

### MQTT Issues

1. Verify MQTT broker settings
2. Check if MQTT integration is enabled in Home Assistant
3. Ensure MQTT credentials are correct
